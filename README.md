#Bog app

This project went pretty well for me, it felt pretty quick each time I created the app. There were lots of small problems that I would run into each time but luckly I was able to figure them out and each time I ran into the same problem it became easier to fix becuse I'd seen it before. Each time was a little faster the the first but in the end my times said around 45 minutes becuse I tended to get distracted.

My biggest tip for others would be to make sure you keep an eye on the plurals and singliur forms of the words your using most of my problems came from writing creature instead of creatures.
